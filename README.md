## Overview

- Perfect print to A4. This is just a web app that's made to be printable, you'll see exactly what will be printed.
- Set quick data (name, website, etc) in a json file, and larger texts (like your cover letter) in a markdown file. The app knows how to pull its data from those.
- This serves as a CV template example. You can clone this and change it however you like.
