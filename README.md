## Overview

- Perfect print to A4. This is just a web app that's made to be printable, you'll see exactly what will be printed.
- Set quick data (name, website, etc) in a json file, and larger texts (like your cover letter) in a markdown file. The app knows how to pull its data from those.
- This serves as a CV template example. You can clone this and change it however you like.

## Configuration

Configurable things are all put under [src/content](src/content):

- [config.json](src/content/config.json): Contains quick data and some configuration options
- [certs.md](src/content/certs.md): Education and certifications you've gained
- [cover-letter.md](src/content/cover-letter.md): Your cover letter
- [languages.md](src/content/languages.md): Languages proficiency
