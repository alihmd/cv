Dear recruiting team at Line Fukuoka,

This letter is to express my interest in your posting for a Front-end Engineer.

With 4+ years of experience as a Full-stack engineer, I am confident I will be an asset to your organization.

I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me and the success of any organization.

Your listed requirements closely match my background and skills. A few I would like to highlight that would enable me to contribute to your bottom line are:
• Extensive experience in development with a focus on JavaScript
• Expertise knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript
• SPA (Single-page Application) implementation experience
• Experience with CSS pre-processors
• Passion towards OSS!

In addition to that, I'd like to mention that I'm very motivated to continue learning Japanese and would love to work and live in Japan!

On the second page is my resume which details my experience in software development. I can be reached anytime via my cell phone, +31629453126, or via email at hammoudali000@gmail.com.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I am looking forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.

Sincerely,
Ali Hammoud
